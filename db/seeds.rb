    title: "Getting Started with Ruby on Rails",
    body: "Ruby on Rails is a web application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Rails is opinionated software and assumes that there is a 'best' way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that wayâ€”and in some cases to discourage alternatives."

    title: "The Power of Active Record",
    body: "Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database. It is an implementation of the Active Record pattern which itself is a description of an Object Relational Mapping system."

  {
    title: "Building Modern UIs with Hotwire",
    body: "Hotwire is an alternative approach to building modern web applications without using much JavaScript by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire. This makes for fast first-load pages, keeps template rendering on the server, and allows for a simpler, more productive development experience in any programming language, without sacrificing any of the speed or responsiveness associated with a traditional single-page application."
